OpenCollarAO
============

Mission Goals
-------------

- Full integration for collar version 3.920
- Must stay ZHAOII for cross-grid compatibility

Mission Extras
--------------

- Add an option to override [ Typing ]
- Explore possibilities to digest ORACUL config cards
	Could we have them working without any reformatting? Would writing a converter be the better option?
- Your idea goes there.
